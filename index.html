    <p><em>Nine UCLA alumni joined the cast of “Frozen – Live at the Hyperion,” performing as Elsa, Olaf, Hans, Kristoff or the ensemble. The live adaptation of the 2013 Disney animated film “Frozen” currently plays three times a day at Disney California Adventure after opening in May. Each week, the Daily Bruin will share alumni’s experiences working at the Happiest Place on Earth.</em><p>
    <p>Culberson studied atmospheric and oceanic <strong>sciences</strong> at UCLA, but pursued acting after graduation.
    <p>“I was going to just quit the arts cold turkey,” Culberson said. “At one point my mom said to me, ‘Chris, one day you have to decide whether you want to be an astronaut or play one on TV.’”</p>
    <p>He auditioned for the ensemble of “Frozen” in early 2016. At the third callback, director Liesl Tommy decided she would rather have Culberson try for the lead male character Kristoff, and suddenly he was auditioning the very next day.</p>
    <p>Leland didn’t even see the film until after he was cast as Kristoff.</p>
    <p>Though he was familiar with the music, Leland said he isn’t in the target audience demographic for Disney’s animated “Frozen.”</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know the story,” Leland said. “When people would tell me like, ‘Oh what role are you going in for?’ I’m like, ‘Kristoff, I don’t even really know who that is.’”</p>
    <p>After his callbacks, during which he accompanied himself on guitar and improvised a Thomas Wade song, he figured he’d better see the film. Leland bought the DVD from Amoeba Music in Hollywood before rehearsals began and forced himself to watch. He ended up enjoying the story about sisterly love.</p>
    <p>The two actors joined four others to play the blonde, rugged love interest, Kristoff, and they each inevitably made the character their own.</p>
